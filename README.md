# Overview
This is a project I created as a way to practice my data analysis skills. It is a simple program that takes olympic metal statistics and finds out who won the most medals and a few similar questions.

The data I am using contains each countries attendance and winnings. It can be found [here](https://github.com/rashida048/Datasets/blob/master/olympics.csv)

# Data Analysis Results

During the analysis I asked 4 questions:
1. Who won the most metals during each of the games? Who is the overall winner?
    - The USA had the most summer games medals, as well as the most overall win medals, with 2399 and 2681 respectivley
    - Norway has won the most winter games medals with 329 medals
2. Who won the least metals during each of the games? Who is the overall loser?
    - Liechtenstein has won 0 summer medals, making them the lowest
    - For the winter games, a lot of countries have 0 medals. I would say Argentina is the worst, as they have atteneded the most games without a earning a medal. with 18 games attended and 0 medals won
    - For total medals, there were many countries with only 1 medal. 
3.  What is the average medals won?
    - Summer games: 100.78082191780823
    - Winter games: 19.623287671232877
    - Both games: 120.4041095890411
4. What is the total number of medals won?
    - Summer games: 14714
    - Winter games: 2865
    - Both games: 17579

# Development Environment

This was developed using Python, Pandas, and VScode

# Useful Websites

* [w3schools' Pandas tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/default.asp)
* [And their dataframe tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/pandas_dataframes.asp)

# Future Work

* Making a graphical representation would be awesome!
* Find who has the most medals per attendance
* As well as find the least medals per attendance
